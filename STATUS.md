# STATUS.md — current checkpoint

_Updated 2026-10-09 at the end of the Milestone 3 implementation session._

## Git
- **Branch:** `claude/milestone-3-live-ai`, based on `main`.
- **`main`:** `71f5f2f` (original dashboard) → `d37db1f` (bootstrap: M1+M2 import, hardened `.gitignore`).
- **This checkpoint:** the commit that last touched this file (`git log -1 -- STATUS.md`).
- **GitHub sync:** NOT YET VERIFIED ON REMOTE when this file was written. The push from the cloud
  session was refused (HTTP 403: the Claude GitHub App is not installed for this repo). The
  commits exist locally and in the Mac checkout. See TASKS M3-C1. Before this run the remote was empty.

## Milestone
Milestone 3 (real LLM behind the abstraction, with numeric safety) is implemented and tested.
Close-out tasks remain: push and CI, one live smoke call, merge.

## What works
- Deterministic dashboard (`python dashboard_builder.py data`). This file was unchanged by M3.
- Agent context, scoring, growth, scenarios and SQLite action state (M1).
- FastAPI backend. It starts with no key, and every deterministic endpoint works with AI disabled (M2).
- **M3:**
  - `services/ai/openai_provider.py`: Responses API, Pydantic structured output, finite timeout,
    bounded transient retries, `store=False`, every error categorized and none raised.
  - `services/ai/factory.py`: the only provider-selection point (`disabled|mock|openai|anthropic`).
  - `config.ai_settings()`: `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
    `AI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `AI_MAX_RETRIES`, `AI_REASONING_EFFORT`. `.env` is auto-loaded.
  - `services/evidence.py`: evidence packets, Turkish display formatting, minimization validation.
  - `services/ai/grounding.py`: fact-id validation, placeholder resolution, numeric guard.
  - `services/agent.py`: grounded pipeline with one bounded stricter retry. KAPALI rules are enforced
    in Python. Provider exceptions are contained.
  - `services/store.py`: an `ai_calls` metadata table (no prompts or content), exposed at `GET /api/ai/calls`.
  - API responses now carry `evidence[]` (fact id, label, Python display value), `ai_error_category`
    and `ai_warnings`.
  - `services/context.py`: KAPALI customers removed from overstock buyer candidates (D-009).

## Tests (actual results, 2026-10-09)
| Where | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline before M3, Mac, real data | `python -m pytest tests/ -q` | **32 passed** |
| Baseline before M3, no data (CI-like) | same | 27 passed, 1 failed, 4 errors (needed real Excel) |
| After M3, cloud, no data | `python -m pytest -q` | **106 passed, 7 skipped (local_data), 1 xfailed** |
| After M3, Mac VM, real 5 Oct 2026 data | `python -m pytest -q` | **113 passed, 1 xfailed** |

The xfail is the strict known issue DQ-1 (dashboard margin treats missing cost as zero).
CI: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` exists but has not run yet, because nothing has been pushed.

## Live provider test
SKIPPED. No `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists in this environment or in the Mac project folder (there is no `.env`).
`scripts/live_smoke_test.py` printed `SKIPPED: OPENAI_API_KEY not set — no live call made.`
Next: TASKS M3-C2.

## Provider configuration
Default `AI_PROVIDER=disabled`. The OpenAI default model `gpt-5-mini` lives in
`config.DEFAULT_MODELS`. It has not been verified live; override it with `AI_MODEL`.

## Not implemented / known issues
- Milestone 4 (live macro data) and Milestone 5 (dashboard AI tab) are not started.
- DQ-1: dashboard margin uses `fillna(0)` for missing cost (owner decision needed).
- DQ-2: the dashboard "Stok Eritme" list still includes KAPALI customers (owner decision needed).
- The lapsed qualification window is 2021–2025 in code but 2020–2025 in the spec (TASKS *Blocked*).
- `arama_listesi.py` is missing. It wasn't in the M1/M2 zips or on the Mac.
- The numeric guard catches digits and common magnitude or percent words. It doesn't catch every
  spelled-out small number (for example "iki müşteri").

## Local-only dependencies
- Python 3.12+ (`dashboard_builder.py` doesn't parse on 3.10).
- Real exports in `./data` (Mac): `2020-5 ekim satışlar.xlsx`, `STOK 5 Ekim 2026.xlsx`, `Cari 5 Ekim 2026.xlsx`.
- A pre-M3 backup of the Mac folder: `~/Desktop/ME/Projects/StockAgent_backup_2026-10-08_pre-M3`.

## Immediate next task
TASKS M3-C1: push both branches and confirm CI is green.
